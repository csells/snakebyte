# snakebyte

Following along with [this most excellent tutorial to build Snake](https://blog.devgenius.io/lets-create-a-snake-game-using-flutter-and-flame-38482d3cf0ff) using [the Flame game engine for Flutter](https://flame-engine.org/).

Updating it as I go to implement [my old favorite Apple \]\[+ game Snake Byte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_Byte), shown [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ1fBpcLCYE) on YouTube.

All of this is nominally in service of learning [the ECS pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) in an environment that I'm already familiar with ([Flutter](https://flutter.dev)).
